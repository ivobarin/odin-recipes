<h1 align='center'>Argentine Recipes Website</h1>

In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.<br>
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes and some other simple stuff. Once is completed, the main stracture will be supported by HTML, CSS and JS. This version will not include any type of stylesheet or any dynamic behavior whatsoever; Any major web-desing choices will be include on futher releases. The current state of the site is only an HTML knowledge test for the course. (_may change in the future_)

Well I tried to make an small modification about what was the site's original concept. I wanted to make a regional recipes site about my country. Nevertheless this is my first release ever so plis don't be upset if the site looks bad for now.

I implemented the first two recipes (actually one of them is not even a recipe nvm). But I will try to focus on another project for the moment...
