    <img src=".\img\mate.jpg" alt="serving_mate_img" />
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Mate</strong> is an regional drink prepared with the leaves of Ilex paraguariensis, a tree exclusive to the subtropical regions of South America.<br>
        Although mate is very versatile, both in its preparation and in its various health benefits; in its classic version, it is consumed hot and bitter. This is the preferred way for Argentinians, and it is not in vain that Argentina is the largest producer of yerba mate in the world and one of the main consumers: 9 out of 10 Argentinians drink mate.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A mate (container), a bombilla (thin tube for sipping the infusion), and preferably a thermos that helps to maintain the water temperature for a longer time.</li>
      <li>Good quality yerba mate.</li>
      <li>Ideally, use a kettle to heat the water, as it allows for better temperature control. But any container of boiled water won't make any difference</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Heat water between 158 ⁰F and 176 °F. Make sure the water hasn't boiled. <strong>We don't want that to happen</strong></li>
      <li>Fill 3/4 of the mate with yerba mate.</li>
      <li>Cover the mate with your hand, turn it upside down, and gently shake it to mix the components well.</li>
      <li>Gradually lift the mate up to an inclination of about 45 degrees and pour a little warm water on the side with less yerba, to moist the bottom.</li>
      <li>Add hot water slowly on the side of the bombilla, until foam appears on the surface.</li>
      <li>As the yerba absorbs the water and the level decreases, slowly pour it over the bombilla until it reaches the top. The mate is now ready to enjoy!.</li>
    </ol>
